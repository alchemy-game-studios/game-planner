# Game Planner — Product & Business Overview

## What Is Game Planner?

Game Planner is a **graph-first creative IP management and generation platform** designed to help creators build rich fictional worlds and systematically adapt them into products such as games, books, films, or tabletop systems.

Unlike traditional writing tools, wikis, or AI prompt apps, Game Planner treats **IP as a structured, persistent knowledge graph** and **products as projections of that IP**, not the source of truth.

The system combines:
- A Neo4j-backed creative knowledge graph
- Manual world-building tools
- AI-powered generation that is *context-aware, constrained, and canon-respecting*

The goal is not to replace creative authorship, but to **compound creative leverage** over time.

## Core Product Philosophy

### 1. IP First, Products Second
- Universes, characters, places, events, and narratives exist independently of any product.
- Products (games, books, etc.) *adapt* IP entities rather than redefining them.
- This enables reuse, remixing, and multi-media expansion without duplication or drift.

### 2. Graph-First Thinking
- Relationships are first-class data, not implied by folders or text.
- Questions like *who*, *where*, *when*, and *why* are explicit and queryable.
- This structure enables reasoning, consistency checking, and AI assistance.

### 3. AI as an Accelerator, Not the Product
- AI operates on top of the graph, not instead of it.
- Generation produces **structured entities and relationships**, not loose prose.
- The system should feel like a world-building tool, not a chat UI.

### 4. User-Defined Systems
- Attributes, mechanics, and components are templates defined by the user.
- The platform avoids hardcoded genre or gameplay assumptions.
- This keeps the tool flexible across mediums and creative styles.

## AI & Agent Integration Model

### Generators, Not Chatbots
AI is integrated as **specialized generators** that:
- Read relevant subgraphs (local + global context)
- Apply tag-based creative constraints
- Generate structured outputs (entities, mechanics, images)
- Write results back into the graph

Examples:
- Character Generator
- Place Generator
- Event / Narrative Generator
- Mechanics Generator
- Product Adaptation Generator

These are **graph mutators**, not conversational agents.

---

### Context Management via the Knowledge Graph
The graph serves as the context layer:
- Canon entities
- Existing relationships
- Tags (tone, genre, themes)
- Product-specific mechanics and attributes

This allows generation to be:
- Consistent with existing lore
- Constrained by creative intent
- Mechanically compatible with products

---

### Tags as Creative Constraints
Tags are used to encode:
- Tone and mood
- Genre and stylistic influences
- Narrative themes
- Mechanical expectations

Tags reduce prompt verbosity, increase consistency, and give users control over generation without micromanaging prompts.

---

## Monetization Strategy

### Base Subscription (Low Cost)
Covers:
- Persistent IP graph
- Manual editing tools
- Relationship modeling
- Image storage
- Ongoing access to owned data

This tier is intentionally affordable and positions Game Planner as a **creative system of record**, not an AI toy.

---

### Usage-Based Credits (Value-Aligned)
Credits are consumed for:
- Entity generation
- Image generation
- Mechanics and component generation
- Product adaptations

Pricing scales with actual compute cost and perceived creative value.

The model ensures:
- Predictable infrastructure costs
- Fair pricing for heavy users
- Clear mental mapping between value and spend

---

### Design Principle: Safe Exploration
To avoid “credit anxiety,” the system should support:
- Draft vs Canon states
- Cheaper outline or preview generations
- Regeneration discounts
- Batch generation options

Experimentation should feel safe and encouraged.

---

## Target Users

### Primary Audience
- Indie game developers
- Solo creators building long-lived IP
- Small studios planning multi-product worlds
- Advanced tabletop designers
- Transmedia storytellers

These users value:
- Consistency
- Reuse
- Long-term leverage
- Structured creativity

---

### Not Targeted
- Casual writers
- One-off prompt users
- Users seeking fast, disposable content

Game Planner is a **power tool**, not a novelty generator.

---

## Long-Term Vision

Game Planner aims to become:
- A persistent creative substrate
- A structured foundation for AI-assisted design
- A system where worlds outlive individual products
- A tool that compounds creative effort over years, not sessions

The knowledge graph is the core asset.
AI is a multiplier layered on top.

---

## Summary

Game Planner is best understood as:

> **A graph-native, AI-augmented creative system of record for building worlds and turning them into products.**

It brings software engineering discipline to creativity without stripping away authorship or intent.
